git config --global user.name "userName"

The git directory acts as a database for all the changes tracked in git and the Working tree acts as a sandbox where we can edit the current versions of the file.

Head is the current checked out snapshot.

Git Project consists of 3 sections:
1)Git directory
2)Staging Area
3)Working Tree

1)Git Directory :- Contains the history of all files & the changes.
2)Staging Area :- also known as the index, is a file maintained by git that contains all the information about what files and changes are 			  going to go into your next commit.
3)Working Tree :- Contains the current state of the project.

*) add command :- add the current changes to the list of changes that are to be commited.
              i.e. moves the current changes to the staging area.
             
*) git add . :- Moves all untracked files to the staging area.
              
*) commit command :- Creates a snapshot of the files present in staging area & stores them in the database that lives in the git directory.

*) git commit -m "message"

*) git config -l :- Shows basic info like userName, email.

*) git log :- Displays commit messages.

*) git push --set-upstream origin development

*) git checkout fileName //revert changes to modified unstaged file before they are staged. i.e : Restore the unstaged file to its earlier 			staged version

*) git reset HEAD fileName //move file from staged area to unstaged area

*) git revert HEAD // creates a new commit with inverse changes
               i.e It doesn't mean undo. Instead, It creates a commit that contains the inverse of all changes made in bad commit in order 
                   to cancel them out.
