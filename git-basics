The git directory acts as a database for all the changes tracked in git and the Working tree acts as a sandbox where we can edit the current versions of the file.

Git Project consists of 3 sections:
1)Git directory
2)Staging Area
3)Working Tree

1)Git Directory :- Contains the history of all files & the changes.
2)Staging Area :- also known as the index, is a file maintained by git that contains all the information about what files and changes are 			  going to go into your next commit.
3)Working Tree :- Contains the current state of the project.
